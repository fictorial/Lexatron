to do
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- ios6 compat check esp. screen size for iphone5
    - dl new xcode and ios6 sdk; test
    - do the simulator trick to get the weird screen size
- add tweet button to find-opponent like in WordGame
- acl security
- matches stored with no turns... wtf? "no description available" in activity
    - Show match id in the logs so I can cross-ref with data browser
- modal views don't autorotate on ipad?
- auto-detect no turn played in X days => timeout
    - run job on heroku?
- in-match chat
    - just add a single message per turn; disable the button otherwise
------------------------------------------------------------------------
launch
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- video trailer on youtube, website
    - use fictorial.com/lexatron/trailer (bit.ly/lexatron)
- press release
- how to build-up hype?
- iversion support
- ask beta testers who wants to be listed in the credits
- itunesconnect metadata (screenshots, copy)
    - launch at $0.99 and stay there or later go up to $1.99
      with copy like "limited time 50% off launch sale"
------------------------------------------------------------------------
post-launch
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- update facebook auth dialog settings with itunes app store app id
------------------------------------------------------------------------
maybe later features
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- 
- game center leaderboards
    - most wins, highest scores
    - anyone really give a shit about this?
- add a particle emitter over the two stars
    - only current player's is displayed
    - as they get closer, more particles are emitted...
- handle dropping to dead zone by adding to nearest cell?
- look up placed word in iOS dictionary and show in a ticker
- animate the shuffle
- nudge an opponent
    - sends a new push if time since last turn > 3 days
    - if > 7 days, auto-win
    - check time on the server not the client (how?)
- only play against users with same version of app
    - this would allow us to update the rules/words post launch
- detect pirated copy
    - if detected, say server not available
- blocked users (add, delete, list)
- cheaters can hack the word list and add words to cheat. perhaps the opponent
  should verify that a played word is actually in their local dictionary too?
  - add md5sum of wordlist into the app? hmac-sha1? check it at startup
- mac os x version for the mac app store using chameleon or something
