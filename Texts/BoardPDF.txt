I designed the board in Omnigraffle which is HORRIBLE for pixel-level support.

Select what you want to export and export Current Selection.

If you have some object which non-pixel boundaries, OG will pad by say 2 pixels
all around for no reason.

If you stroke an object, it's rendered centered so be prepared for cut-off
pixels.

Do not enable shadows at any cost

Etc. etc.

The easiest way to get the area of the board I want for the game is to 
- select all
- export Current Selection to PDF
- Load the PDF into Preview.app
- Set a crop box of 2.5, 2.5, 450, 225 and resave
- Use UIImage+PDF in the app to convert to a UIImage

In the app, I create 2 images from the PDF, one for when the board is zoomed out
and another for when the board is zoomed in.  Why?  Well, if we use the
high-resolution image when zoomed out, you'll notice jaggies along cell
boundaries b/c information must be thrown away to scale down.
