Getting bored of the same old word games?  Why not try Lexatron!

Lexatron is a two-player turn-based word game played on a unique X-shaped board.

Start on one of the corners of the board and form words by placing letters from
your rack.  Reach the opposite corner of the board and you win!  

Lexatron is simple to learn yet difficult to master.

If you and your opponent get blocked from reaching the opposite corner, the
winner is the player with the most points when the letters run out!

Play against a random online opponent, a contact from your Address Book, a
Facebook friend, or someone right next to you on the bus or plane via a
"pass-and-play" match.  You can even invite all of TweeterBookâ„¢ to challenge
you to a match!

If you love other famous word games, you might just love Lexatron too! ðŸ’™
