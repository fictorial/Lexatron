Our original tile distribution comes from other popular word games.

However, while those games have 15*15=225 cells, we have 29*29=841 cells.

We have ~4x as many cells in Lexatron. 

We need more tiles else the players will run out mid-game! 

Thus, I'm simply added a proportionally larger number of tiles (4x WWF).
