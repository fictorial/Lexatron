    <h3>How to Play Lexatron</h3>

    <p>You play as green or orange. Form words by dragging letters to the board,
    starting on your <em>arrow</em> space. First one to their <em>star</em> space wins!
    If all the letters run out, the winner is the player with the most points.
    Place <em>bomb</em> tiles (if you have one) to blow up letters and clear yourself a path.
    Good luck!</p>
