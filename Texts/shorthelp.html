    <h3>How to Play Lexatron</h3>
    
    <p>
    Lexatron is a two-player turn-based word game.
    You play as either green or orange.
    Place letters from your rack on the board (via drag and drop).
    </p>

    <p>
    Start on your start space (the green/orange space with an <em>arrow</em>)
    and form words along a path to your end space (the green/orange space with a <em>star</em>).
    Words are formed along diagonal lines (left to right or top to bottom) with your letters only.
    </p>

    <p>
    Reach your end space before
    your opponent reaches their end space and you win the match!
    If all the letters run out, the winner is the player with the most points.
    </p>
